#### Prerequisite:

Wireshark with the <b>omci.lua</b> and <b>BinDecHex.lua</b> plug-ins installed.


#### Procedure:

In devices like the SFP module <b>G-010S-A</b> or the 1-port ONT <b>G-010G-A</b>, it is possible to capture OMCI messages, which can be useful in troubleshooting performance problems.
In the SFP module, this function is only possible with the latest firmware versions, like 3FE46398BGCB22.

After powering up and synchronizing with OLT, the device creates an <b>omcimsg.txt</b> file in the <b>/tmp</b> folder. This file is eventually deleted after a few minutes or overwritten with periodic diagnostic data.
The file capturing the initial OMCI replacement should be 25KB-90KB in size. If it is not there or is very small, it is still possible to force an OMCI exchange by unplugging the green fiber connector and plugging it back in while the device is powered on. This should create a new omcimsg.txt file, which should be retrieved rather quickly.



Sample log retrieved from the device

```
To convert log to hex format readable by Wireshark
   
```
awk -F"ms-" '{print$2}' omcimsg.txt | sed -e 's/^/000000 /' > omci.hex
```

To open the file omci.hex in Wireshark
```
File -> Import from Hex Dump
Encapsulation Type -> Ethernet
set Ethernet -> Ethertype (hex): 88b5
Import
```
