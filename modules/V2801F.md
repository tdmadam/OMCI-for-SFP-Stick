## Enable OMCI logs for V2801F(RTL9601CI) in the raw format


```
omcicli set logfile 1 ffffffff
```
This command activates raw OMCI logs at runtime and stores it in the /tmp folder as omcilog. 

Sample output:

```
80 3e 49 0a 00 02 00 00 80 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 28 43 d8 84 c6

## Extracting OMCI Console logs from V2801F SFP Stick - RTL9601CI   

#### Enable OMCI debug logs (visible on the UART Console)
```
# flash set OMCI_DBGLVL 2
# flash set OMCI_LOGFILE_MASK 2
# reboot
```
Notes:   
DBGLVL - 1 is the lowest, produces no hex dump. 4 is the highest, realtime.   
Also present is the variable OMCI_LOGFILE 0. Changing this variable to 1 does not create any logs in the /tmp folder.   
On the V2801F, the logs are only visible on the UART console.
   
   
#### Example of the console output saved to omci.log   

*It is recommended to save logs and perform file operations on Linux. It may be necessary to use dos2unix to convert line breaks if using Windows.*

#### Filter OMCI from omci.log

  ```
  sed -n '/0x0000:\|0x0010:/p' console.log | awk -F"0x00.0:   " '{print$2}' | sed -r 's/\s+//g' | awk '{ ORS = (NR%4 ? "" : RS) } 1' > omci.log
  ```
  Two OMCI messages after conversion:
  ```
  0000100A000B0401800000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000100000028651AD04F

## Convert omci.log to a format that Wireshark understands   
  ```
  cat omci.log | sed -e 's/.\{2\}/& /g' | sed -e 's/^/000000 /' > omci.hex
  ```
  In order for Wireshark to display these packets, each byte must be separated by a space, and there must be a start offset<000000> in front of it.
   
  The same OMCI messages after conversion:   
  ```
  000000 00 00 10 0A 00 0B 04 01 80 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 28 65 1A D0 4F

  ```  
 This output can be opened in Wireshark as a hex file dump:
   
  File -> Import from Hex Dump   
  Encapsulation Type -> Ethernet   
  set Ethernet -> Ethertype (hex): 88b5   
  Import
